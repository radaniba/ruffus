05/June/2009        v1.0.4 release:     
	Bug fix: 

		task.task_names_to_tasks did not include tasks specified by function rather than name
		
		task.run_all_jobs_in_task, did not work properly without multiprocessing (# of jobs = 1)

		task.pipeline_run only uses multiprocessing pools if multiprocess (# of jobs)  > 1
	
	Changes to allow python 2.4/2.5 to run:
		setup.py changed to remove dependency
		simplejson can be loaded instead of python 2.6 json module
		NamedTemporaryFile to mkstemp because delete parameter is not avaliable before python 2.6

	Windows programmes
		It is necessary to protect the "entry point" of the program under windows.
		Otherwise, a new process with be created recursively, like the magicians's apprentice
		See: http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming
