=============================
Whence the name "Ruffus"?
=============================

.. image:: images/cyl_ruffus.jpg

**Cylindrophis ruffus** is the name of the 
`red-tailed pipe snake <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrophis_ruffus>`_ (bad python-y pun)
which can be found in `Hong Kong <http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/index.html>`_ where the author comes from.
Be careful not to step on one when running down country park lanes at full speed 
in Hong Kong: this snake is a `rare breed <http://www.hkras.org/eng/info/hkspp.htm>`_!

Ruffus is a shy creature, and pretends to be a cobra by putting up its red tail and ducking its
head in its coils when startled. It does most of its work at night and sleeps during the day:
typical of many python programmers!
